# DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK

The client crashes when attempting to authenticate, I don't know how to resolve
this, but it's the furthest I've ever gotten trying to get the client to work
on other distros.

You can modify the volumes section of the `compose.yml` to mount your profiles
into the container.
